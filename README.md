## Python Tutorials

I left you one Python tutorial so far (the file `tut1.py`). You can create a python script by naming the file with the `.py` extension. Your Mac comes with a Python interpreter built in, so you can run it too. To try this out, just create a python script on your desktop named `hi.py`. Just put this line in that file:
```python
print("Hello World!")
```

You can then run that file by opening up the terminal and typing `python desktop/hi.py`. You should see the terminal say "Hello World!". You can text me anytime you need help. I'll just put each tutorial in this repository like I did with `tut1.py`.
